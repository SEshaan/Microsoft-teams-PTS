# Microsoft-teams-PTS
microsoft teams push to talk(browser only)

- Just copy and paste main.js into your console in a teams meeting website and press space to talk

Teams has no push to talk so i made my own,
under the request of my friends i have decided to make this public to others who want push to talk

# Hope microsoft adds pts soon!
