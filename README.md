microsoft teams push to talk(browser only)

# Just copy and paste main.js into your console in a teams meeting website and press space to talk

Teams has no push to talk so i made my own
under the request of my classmates i have decided to make this public to others who want push to talk

# Hope microsoft adds this soon!
